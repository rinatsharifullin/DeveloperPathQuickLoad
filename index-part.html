It was a great course.Would definitely recommend finglas training centre and their lovely staff everyone is so nice and welcoming there,especially the man on reception always acknowledges you and greets you with a smile. My lovely tutor was Marilyn Kelly. she's just amazing at her job,intrigued by her knowledge and teaching method. She's such a normal genuine lady.She was so attentive towards her students and always had time for us. Will really miss coming here and learning/laughing each week.Thank you for the education Marilyn now on to new beginnings üòçüòç

                                I would recommend Finglas Training Centre and their fantastic Tutors especially Marilyn Kelly. I just finished an 11 week course with her, Receptionist & Frontline Office Skills. I can't believe how much we learnt and the amount of information she gave us. Marilyn really went out of her way to help us achieve the end result, she is so patient and generous with her time working as she does to a deadline. There is a lot of course content, lots to take in and learn but so enjoyable because of Marilyn. A lot of laughs were had over the weeks as there were a wonderful bunch of ladies taking the course too. Thank you Marilyn

                                I completed my Leaving Certificate in 2008 and I didn‚Äôt have amazing points. I had no interest in going to college at the time as I wanted to work. At the age of 17 years I started the Legal Administrator course at CDETB Finglas Training Centre. As part of the course I did a work placement with Brophy Solicitors a small law firm in Dublin city. I worked there for the period of my placement and was delighted to be offered a job on a permanent basis. After a year working in Brophys I decided to further my education and over a period of years I completed my Certificate, Diploma and Law Degree in Griffith College at night. On completion of my Law Degree I was offered a job in Mason Hayes & Curran one of the biggest law firms in the country. I am proud to say I have assisted on some really big projects here over the years. I have recently joined the firm‚Äôs Innovation Committee. Above all else I am in a job I love. I honestly feel I would not be where I am today if it wasn‚Äôt for the Legal Administrator Course at CDETB Finglas Training Centre.

                                My time at Finglas training centre has been fantastic. Having no previous experience of software development the hands on approach of coding everyday along with the support I received really gave me the confidence to be successful in the industry. Upon completion of the course I secured a full time job in software development and would really recommend the training centre to anyone looking to further their career.
